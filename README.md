# zeeprinter

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I wanted an easier way to make a PDF file of Munzee QRCodes for printing on the labels I use to make stickers. I used to manually position every sticker in Microsoft Word on an Avery Labels template.

## Dependencies

I used [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for the UI, and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons.
I used [qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) to generate the QR Codes, and [jspdf](https://parall.ax/products/jspdf) to create the PDF output.
